## Hi, I'm Ben!

I'm an undergraduate student at USU studying computer science. Most of my work is private here in order to be academically ethical, but I promise it's REALLY cool...

I love golf, reading, snowboarding, and spending time with my family.

My highest priority is my education, and I plan to graduate with a BS in 2026 and an MCS in 2027. Have a look around!
